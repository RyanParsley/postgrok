title: Great and Terrible Lies
---

Our new president lies. Like... a lot. Despite clearly logging more than 10,000 
hours designing realities, he doesn't seem all that good at it. Most of his 
lies can be disproved with minimal research and that doesn't seem to matter.
People call him out on his fabrications and that doesn't matter. He keeps
spinning yarns and enough people continue to believe them.

That's the part I have the hardest time understanding: why doesn't he need to be
a better liar to get away with it? It's easy enough to make a snarky comment on 
"honest politician" being an oxymoron (many people have), but this is beyond 
manipulative smooth talking to lubricate the machine. He's spewing a fever dream 
and his base is eating it up. Facts presented in opposition to his fantasies are 
dismissed as "fake".

## Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics

In his inauguration speech, Trump described a fictitious dystopian version of 
America. This *alternative america* he described was plagued by joblessness. 
Meanwhile, in reality, [jobs][jobs] are up and [unemployment][unemployment] is
down. 

Later, he said, "You will never be ignored again." Then, ignores a 
[petition][petition] to share his tax documents. 

At one point, he said, "We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements 
honestly...", but when embarrassing facts were made public, the 
[source was silenced][nps]

Perhaps his greatest lie was that his presidency marks "the day the people 
became the rulers of this nation again". I'd believe that can only be true of a 
president that received the popular vote. He doesn't strike me as a particularly 
good liar, yet his lies have gotten him about as far as one can imagine.
